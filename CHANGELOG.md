## v2.0.0 — 2026-05-10

### BREAKING CHANGE — `BaseGenerator::writeFile()` skips existing files by default

Previously `writeFile()` called `file_put_contents()` unconditionally. As of v2.0.0, if the target file already exists and `$this->force === false`, `writeFile()` returns `false` immediately without writing. Re-running a generator on an already-scaffolded module will skip (not overwrite) existing files, preserving any hand-edits.

**Upgrading:** Any caller that expects overwrite behaviour must call `$gen->setForce(true)` before `$gen->generate()`.

### Added — `BaseGenerator::setForce(bool $force): self`

Fluent setter that bypasses the skip guard when set to `true`. When `force` is `false` (the default), `generate()` returns `false` for any file that already exists on disk.

### Merge-aware generator exemption

The following generators internally set `$this->force = true` in their constructors and are unaffected by the guard — they load-then-merge existing JSON and must always overwrite:

- `RegistryGenerator`
- `MenusJsonGenerator`
- `ModulesJsonGenerator`
- `MobileAppModulesJsonGenerator`
